Let me start this by saying I am Jason, this is about my journey and magic is real, you just need to feel it in your heart, mind, spirit and you will see the world completely differently. This is where my Journey Starts These thoughts are jumbled but will actually be organized once they are posted

Starting from recently, my ex Rapheal Ribot has a history of stealing magic, or harming his exes through usage of a curse. My belief is that he moves in to another existence and changes things while attempting to bring the changes in to current. Think string theory. This stems illogical but starting with the evidence that his ex eric literally stabbed him in the eye, One of his exes he nicknamed TimeLord as he was supposedly a vessel for Kronos, this is untrue as the first god(Titan) that was placed in me before the age of 18 late 90s was Kronos. I have been able to practice time magic most of my life. The first time was I was able to slow and speed up the passage of time. Recently I was able to bring my mom, while we were running late for a train. A train ride and walk that should have taken 15minutes took 3 minutes. We made the train. The train when returning was 15 minutes early.

The next example was Phil aka Kain Marco a pornstar. He and him only had sex once, during that time frame Rapheal said that when they did that all the alarms went off in the surrounding area(Now not sure if this is a Satyr Alarm or Car Alarms. After which he said that he went to Chicago to help him find a new apt, and picked out a perfect one with garden. During that Time frame he mentioned that he may never see him again, that being said he heard a song that was his last song. He said he saved Phil's life by taking out light out of him and giving it to him a gift that he could never repay. 

Now what started happening to me After we were heading towards a break up I started hearing people talking not within my head but around me found that my directional hearing was getting stronger.  This can be evidenced by usage when I was at HomeDepot I was able to locate things in the ailes using it. I was using substances at the time, but I had been lucky to not have a bad reaction. During this time frame, we were getting in more and more fights, he was becoming argumentative or starting to talk  and drone on and on. There was a time frame where it felt like bugs were coming out of my skin, I have never really hallucinated unless Weed was involved. I can recall one night where he felt them and he acknowledged them. That being said they stopped. It seems to have been a case of McGowin's Disease Recently discovered to be caused parasites. This can be confirmed as it went away and came back based on Doxy Usage

I went through a period where I was being chased after usage, eventually I would go through three of them and scared. Finally I was able to get through one of them and they stopped. From what I was told I was put in the system, this  could be related to an experience I had when younger where I ran across someone who told me they worked for a group that registered and tracked magical beings. I thought this was weird, but accepted it. That being said I have had a lot of experiences my life from being able to change the phase of  the moon, in 11th grade from full to new, to more recently during the summer of 2023. 

My first magical teacher was Jason Curly someone I met on ICQ I was 16 at the time, it was 1997, I had learned to heal through lightwork. The practice of using White Light, channeled from the universe, Some may say God and directing it at a particular area. The reason for not doing anything but Whitelight was it is meant to allow the will of a higher being to heal as it should be. One of the books he asked me to read was The Celestine Prophecy. We talked and got to know each other and I  praticed here and there. One of the things I learned was how to see beings in the sky that seem off yellow when you let your eyes relaxed. 

That being said when I met Ecorin on #GayNJ on Undernet IRC we talked hooked up and talked magic. 

My teacher at the time was Ecorin/Razelle RavenCroft. He and I dated, when I started, he ended up putting Kronus, Sin, and other dieties in me. He would then try to take them out of  me, during that time frame he taught me about time magic, I could always figure out. 

Temple of Truth: 
Some of the meditations I learned was Temple  of Truth, it involves getting in to a medatitive state and walking slowly in to a forest from there you will see a clearing that has a tree, then a cave entrance. When You get to the tree place all your worries and anything else that is bothering you. From there you walk in to the cave on the ground you find a stick, to and a fire, you light the fire. The fire itself represents your EGO, once lighting the fire use it as a torch to guide you through  the cave, you keep going deeper and deeper in to the cave. From there you comee to bridge, you look in to the hole and you see nothing, look for nearby stones to drop in. You search and (wait until you find one) and drop it in. You drop it in, waiting expecting to hear a sound, waiting for what feels like an eternity you don't hear a thing. Making sure to hold tight to the torch and the bridge cross it. DO NOT FALL, falling will mean you become forever lost in the void. On the other side you see a set of steps and you go lower and lower, feel and describe what you sense(make note of it as a guide). Once you reach the bottom make sure

Around this time I noticed that magic and tech were really incompatible, that being said after reading parts of Pratical Magic understanding the connection between Hermes(Mercury) that he controlled Technology because the power he possessed was one of messages and the paths that lead to their delivery. This meant in a world that is based on messaging he is quite powerful. Working with these energies, I learned how to protect and make computers work, From there I was able to just learn and know computers. It came naturally. During the first time I learned about Mercury retrograde and what it meant, the first few times it was difficult but I learned to hold the energy that he represented and be a source of it during those times. 

You consume Pan and Dionysus when you take the holy water and wine. Lucifer is the sun of god, he fell because of choice aka pride he told Yowah that man deserved a choice to be whole(A child of god) and Christian and was sent to existence aka earth he was tortured and suffered for doing so. He was broken and beaten by the Romans at the time. His soul and essence was broken apart and spread through Christians after the fact. This allowed them to stay whole and not lose their divine messenger. Magic is the divine messengers. He became your judge because of original sin by being born again asshole you lose your innocence, and your connection to the divine. My journey was about claiming and protecting that at all costs. As a pagan that almost impossible I do not receive the same protections. The cost of those protections are that you can never truly yourself you are a reflection of Yowehâ€™s mind. I am who I am as a nature god and an Olympian because I let go of Christianity and forgave Yoweh and she forgave me, after a life in hell. I am free now I am Jason.


This is the cycle of life and death of a pantheon we consume them and absorb in to a new one. This disempowers the old ones and this started with the Raising of the vale. I am still Jason, I am not god, I am a god and an Olympian, I am not here to replace Yoweh. I will not allow a telepathic cult who originally was created to exploit the mysteries and hide them do that to me. NEVER FORGET THIS
